# Visualizing Bike Sharing Data for NYC
--
## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the project is to explore the possibilty of establishing a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. The data used to determine user behaviour is from New York City (Citi-Bike) user information, which can be used as indicative data to enable business decisions to be made for the execution of the Des Moines, bike share project plan.

In order to build user data and visualizations to present key insights to investors, we use the following tools for the development and execution of our visualizations;

* Pandas - Use of Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to prepare data
* Tableau - Use to access extract data and build Tableau Stories
* GitHub - Share Written Report and Link to Tableau Stories

Some of the key visualization outputs required for assessment is as follows;

* Length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* No. of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* No. of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

The following report sections describe some key highlights on the outcome of the project.

## Results

When considering the users of NYC Citibike, we cannot directly compare the user profiles to what we may expect at Des Moines, but the data might be indicative of what key facets of user behavior we can come to expect.

Consiering the key user profile as depicted in the following image, we can determine the following insights of the typical bike share user;

![User_Profile](/Images/User_Profile.png)

* We have a total of near 2.5 million users and we can determine the proportion of users vs. population + tourists
* Ridership is predominantly Male with over 65% identifying as Male
* Tendency to be a subscriber is higher when gender is disclosed
* User traffic determined by start and end locations are limited mainly to key metro regions
